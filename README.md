- I'm a graduate student seeking a Master of Science at Purdue University in Fort Wayne. My research focuses on image detection, restoration, recognition, and segmentation for Computer Vision applications. I have experience in hardware and software, as well as computer architecture design, automatic control systems, electrical circuit design and analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. 
I am someone who can adapt to any scenario, strive in a changing environment, and turn unanticipated difficulties into stepping stones to success. I continually innovate to provide value, and I transform ideas into projects, and projects into serial successes.
